So we have an idea for this new project that we have.
It is a B2C platform for an optics e-commerce store.

We already have the infrastructure from Dubros, which includes all the inventory and products to sell.
What we want is to create a new interface specifically for B2C customers.

This interface — in its first version, the MVP — should prioritize the customer user experience:
where the user can browse the catalog and filter products using specific filters relevant to the optical industry, such as:
	•	lens size,
	•	material, and
	•	frame shape.

Since we’re talking B2C, the platform should also include a purchase flow where the user can:
	1.	View the product details.
	2.	Decide whether they want it with prescription lenses.
	3.	Enter their prescription directly on the site.
	4.	Select optional treatments for the lenses — for example, photochromatic, anti-reflective (AR), or blue-coat lenses.
	5.	Check out and buy the product online.

On the administrative side, the system should allow:
	•	Bulk creation of products via CSV upload.
	•	Editing or deleting single products manually (1 by 1) directly from the admin interface.
	•	Editing or deleting products in bulk via CSV file.
	•	Creation, editing, and deletion of lens treatments and other product variables.

Keep in mind, this is just the first-version MVP of the product.
The goal is to establish the core functionality and user flow before adding advanced features later.
